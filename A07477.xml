            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO ALL CHRISTIAN Parents, and Gouernours of Families; Grace &amp; Peace be multiplied.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is (as yee know, welbeloued) the Commandement of God, that Parents ſhould teach and inſtruct their children in the true Religion and worſhip of God, as it is to be ſeene in theſe places following, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.9.6.6.11.18, 19. <hi>Prouerbs</hi> 22.6. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.4. Examples alſo there are of many that did it, as, <hi>Abraham, Dauid, &amp;c. Gen.</hi> 18.19. 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 28.9 <hi>Prouerbs</hi> 4.3, 4. <hi>Timothy</hi> knew the Scriptures from a child, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. &amp; that (no doubt) by the inſtruction of his mother, and his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, who are commended for their faith by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. Secondly, the benefit that
<pb facs="tcp:2418:3"/>followeth heereof, is great, <hi>Prouerbs.</hi> 22.6. And the want heereof is the cauſe of much euill to your children, and (many times) of great griefe to your ſelues. Be diligent therefore and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to performe this duty. Parents generally teach their children to ſay the Lords prayer, the Creede, and the ten Commandements: and it is a good and commendable thing for them ſo to doe. But they are not there to ſtay, (as if it were ſufficient to ſay theſe things without booke) but to goe further, and to teach them the meaning thereof. Many aged perſons there be, that can ſay the words, but vnderſtand little or nothing thereof: nay know not ſo much as what the Creed is, but vſe it for a prayer. The reaſon heerof is, they were not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nſtructed in their youth. That all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (euen the ſimpleſt) may be able to teach their children the meaning of the things afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, I haue heer framed, firſt of all, a very ſhort Catechiſme for little ones; from the age of foure, to 6 or 7 yeeres. In which time I think there is ſcarce any of ſo weak capacitie, but may be able to learne it. Secondly, I haue framed another, fit for ſuch as are of ſix or ſeuen, till they come to ten or twelue yeeres of age, and may in that time be eaſily learned: and the rather, becauſe the firſt is comprehended in it.
<pb facs="tcp:2418:3"/>Then thirdly, I haue more particularly &amp; large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet downe the meaning of each Article of the Creede, of the Sacraments, of euery Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and of euery petition of the Lords prayer: with diuers other points neceſſary to be knowne of all Chriſtians, and that before they come to bee partakers of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. And this alſo may the more eaſily be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, becauſe the ſecond Catechiſme is included in it. And in all three I haue laboured for three things, namely, order, breuitie and plainneſs. For this I finde by (almoſt 30. yeeres) experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, (in the Miniſterie) that things orderly, briefly, and plainely handled, are beſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and ſooneſt learned: and though the Anſweres bee many, yet if they bee ſhort and plaine, both children and others will learne them with eaſe and delight. Concerning the method and order heere obſerued, it is this:</p>
            <p>Firſt, briefly it ſheweth the benefit of Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing, what it is, and what be the parts of it, <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. to <hi>Q.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it ſheweth what God is, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth downe his workes of Creation, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, and namely, mans creation. All which are comprehended in the firſt Article of the Creed, <hi>Queſt.</hi> 8. to 30.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it diſcouereth our miſery by reaſon
<pb facs="tcp:2418:4"/>of ſinne, <hi>Queſt.</hi> 30. to 44.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it declareth how we are redeemed from our miſery, namely, by Chriſt, where is ſhewed what Chriſt is concerning his perſon, <hi>Queſt.</hi> 44. to 57. Then what hee did to worke our redemption, and to make it perfect, the which is ſet downe in the 4.5. and 6. Articles, <hi>Quest.</hi> 57. to 74. And what is the laſt worke that Chriſt ſhall performe on earth, <hi>Queſt.</hi> 74, 75, 76.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, it maketh knowne, how all that which Chriſt hath done, is made profitable to vs, <hi>Queſt.</hi> 77. to 81.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, it ſheweth who they are which are ſanctified and ioyned to Chriſt, namely, the Church, and what benefits belong to the Church, <hi>Queſt.</hi> 81. to 98.</p>
            <p>Seuenthly, it ſheweth what is required on our behalfe, that we may be partakers of Chriſt and his benefits, namely, a true faith, what this faith is, how it is wrought in vs, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee are ſaid to bee ſaued by faith onely, <hi>Queſt.</hi> 98. to 104.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe the Sacraments are ordained of God for the helpe of our faith, it ſheweth next what theſe Sacraments are, what things are thereby ſignified and ſealed to vs, and what is required to the right vſe of them,
<pb facs="tcp:2418:4"/>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 104. to 144. And foraſmuch as that faith whereby we are iuſtified, is not a dead, but a liuely faith, it ſheweth what this faith doth bring forth in vs, namely, repentance, and repentance good workes: what theſe good workes are, namely, ſuch as God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>Queſt.</hi> 144. to 159. And then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in order the meaning of the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, <hi>Queſt.</hi> 159. to 247. Then after that follow certaine points concerning the Law, as whether wee can bee iuſtified by the workes of the Law? If not, then to what end the Law doth ſerue, and wherefore wee are to doe good workes, how they are to bee done, and whether they ſhall be rewarded of God or no? <hi>Queſt.</hi> 247. to 258.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, it ſheweth that wee of our ſelues can doe no good work, but onely by the grade of God, and that the grace of God is to be obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of vs by prayer: and then followeth the meaning of the Lords prayer and what ſhall become of all after this life, <hi>Quest.</hi> 258. to the end.</p>
            <p>All which things are briefly, familiarly and plainely ſet downe by Queſtions and Anſwers that euen the ſimpleſt may eaſily (if they will vſe the meanes) both learne and vnderſtand the ſame. And becauſe that in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb facs="tcp:2418:5"/>nothing is to bee receiued, but what is plainely proued by the Scriptures, I haue at the end of almoſt euery Anſwere, quoted the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scriptures, for the proofe of the ſame. And the places (for the moſt part) are plaine and eaſie, as you ſhall finde if you turne to them. And that you may ſee that whatſoeuer is neceſſary to be knowne, beleeued and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of vs to ſaluation, is conteined in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, I haue alſo ſet downe in order the very ſubſtance of Diuinity in Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, to the end that all may the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Popery, I haue added a Dialogue betweene a weake Chriſtian, and a Miniſter, ſhewing that Popery is contrary to the very grounds of the Catholike Religion, and that therefore Papiſts cannot be good Catholikes. And this I haue done, not in hatred of their perſons, (for I wiſh vnfainedly their conuerſion in this world, and their ſaluation in the world to come) but in hatred of their falſe doctrine, and that the ſimple may not be ſeduced with the title and colour of Catholikes and Catholike Church. Although many ſound and learned diuines haue of late yeeres fully laid open all points of Popery, and throughly confuted the ſame: yet the vulgar ſort, eyther for want of
<pb facs="tcp:2418:5"/>money to buy their bookes, or leyſure to reade them (being for the moſt part verie large) or elſe for want of knowledge to iudge of them (being learnedly written) know not ſo much as what Popery is: but thinke (yea and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſpeake it) that the Papiſts differ not much from vs, and that wee might bee eaſily recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled.</p>
            <p>For the good therefore of the ſimple and vnlearned, I haue briefly, plainely and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly ſet downe ſuch ſpeciall points, as they doe hold contrary to the very grounds of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: that ſo, ſuch as yet ſtand, may be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the weake ones kept from embracing Popery, and ſuch as are of late falne from vs, may (if Gods will bee ſuch) bee reclaimed.</p>
            <p>By Papiſts I vnderſtand ſuch as cleaue to the Pope in religion, and are obedient vnto him. And I thinke they will not be offended with the name, no more then wee are with the name of Proteſtants. And in ſetting downe their opinions, I deale not with them, as they deale with vs, namely, charging vs with ſuch things as wee teach not, but rather vtterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime.</p>
            <p>As for example: There was not long ſince (in a certaine Citie of this kingdome) appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended a Ieſuite: and among other things
<pb facs="tcp:2418:6"/>found about him, hee had a certaine paper, wherein were 44 poſitions, ſet downe as doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines maintained by Proteſtants: and of theſe 44. almoſt 20 of them were groſſe lies. As for example:</p>
            <p>Firſt, that wee hold and teach, that children are ſaued onely by the faith of their parents without baptiſme.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that one muſt not baptize but at a Sermon.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that God doth not onely permit, but doth cauſe ſinne.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that there is no Cup of conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, that one may preach without being ſent, with ſuch like things; which are moſt notorious lies: for Proteſtants teach no ſuch things, but rather the contrary. If any haue broached ſuch doctrine, if they bee knowne, they are puniſhed by our Church.</p>
            <p>And this hath bin their practice from time to time, in charging vs with ſuch points of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, as were neuer allow'd of, but condemned by vs. In ſetting downe therefore of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, I alleadge eyther their very words, or the ſumme therof, and quote the places where the ſame are to bee found. And I doe not ſet downe the words of ſome priuate man, or of
<pb facs="tcp:2418:6"/>ſuch as are of no account in the Church of Rome, but of their Councell of Trent; the <hi>Rhemiſts, Bellarmine,</hi> and ſuch as whoſe words and writings are approued and allowed of by the Church of Rome.</p>
            <p>And then at the end of euery particular point of Popery, I quote alſo diuers of our owne late Writers, where the points are hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led more at large: ſo that if any be diſpoſed to ſee what they hold, and how they are confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, hee may turne to the Authors, and finde the ſame. And becauſe the Papiſts ſtand ſo much vpon antiquitie, I haue alſo ſet downe the time when the moſt ſubſtantiall points of Popery came firſt into the Church. (See Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>Abbot,</hi> in defence of the reformed Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, <hi>page</hi> 109. to 121.)</p>
            <p>There is one thing, which (it may be) ſome will not like of, and that is, the vſing of ſome homely compariſons, and pleaſant conceites: but I would haue ſuch to know, that a Pill is a very bitter thing, and therefore men (many times) before they come to ſwallow it, will roll it in hony, or ſome other ſweet thing, that it may goe down the more pleaſantly: and therefore I haue done the like with this my Pill, that ſo it may be taken with the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. And heerein I haue done but as <hi>Elias</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:2418:7"/>did with <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 18.27. and no more then <hi>Eſay</hi> did with idolaters in his time, <hi>Eſay</hi> 44.16.</p>
            <p>My requeſt then to you is, that you will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept theſe foure ſmall mites, and employ them for your owne direction, and the good of your families. Teach your little ones the firſt, and then as they growe in yeeres, let them learne the reſt. And heerein you are to haue a reſpect to the nature and condition of your children. If they be but of weake capacitie, and haue but weake memories, you are to require the leſſe of them. If that you would allow them ſome ſmall time in euery weeke to learne the ſame, and euery Lords day (after the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like exerciſes in the Church) you would ſpend but one hour, or halfe, in examining them, you ſhall finde, that in a few yeeres they would euen learn them all. And further, this you ſhal finde, that by teaching your families, you ſhall much profit your ſelues, ſo that when you ſhall heare the Catechiſme expounded in the Church (as Miniſters are now co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to do it) you ſhall by this meanes vnderſtand the better what is taught, and profit a great deale the more by it.</p>
            <p>You ſhall doe well alſo to reade ouer often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Texts of Scriptures (as they are ſet downe in order) and ſo you ſhall ſee how euery
<pb facs="tcp:2418:7"/>point of doctrine (deliuerd by the Miniſter in Catechizing) is confirmed. And concerning the Catechiſme for Catholikes, you ſhall doe well alſo ſometimes to reade it, or cauſe your children to doe it, that ſo you may ſee what Poperie is, and accordingly take heede of it. Theſe things if you be carefull to performe, I doubt not, but (in a ſhort time) you ſhall finde great good to come heereof to your children, much comfort to your ſelues, and God hereby ſhall be glorified: to whoſe moſt bleſſed and holy direction, I commend you now and for euer.</p>

            <head>To the Christian Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is one thing (Chriſtian Reader) which I would haue thee eſpecially to take notice of, concerning the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Principles, or Grounds of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: namely, that nothing is to be receiued for a Principle of Religion, or true and ſound doctrine, which hath not foundation in the Word of God, or is not contained therein: for the Word of God (or the Scripture as we call it) is the rule of all truth, and giues vs a perfect direction, both for faith and manners: and whatſoeuer Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and doctrine is neceſſary to ſaluation, is deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red plainly in the holy Scripture; and therefore in reading this, or any Catechiſm, you are not by and by to beleeue whatſoeuer is therein contained: but to ſee and conſider how euery thing is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Scriptures; for your faith and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence muſt be grounded, not vpon the weake and vnperfect ſpeeches of ſinnefull men, but vpon the pure and ſure Word of God. And therefore at the end of euery anſwere, I haue quoted ſome plaine place of Scripture to confirm the ſame, ſome few only excepted, which though in plain words they are not to be found in the Scriptures, yet by good conſequence they are drawn from the Scriptures. And whatſoeuer is truly and ſoundly collected
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:2418:45"/>from Scripture, is to be beleeued of vs, as though it were expreſly written. As for example, when Chriſt would confute the Sadduces that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the reſurrection, he alleadgeth the words of God to <hi>Moſes:</hi> I am the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> &amp; <hi>Iacob.</hi> From hence this truth is ſtrongly collected, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> ſhall liue, and riſe according to their bodies: becauſe God (ſaith Chriſt) is not the God of the dead, but of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. Therefore now this conſequence, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and the Saints departed, ſhall riſe, muſt bee credited no leſſe then that expreſſe Scripture from whence Chriſt drew it. And to the end that you may ſee, that all neceſſary poynts of faith &amp; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are plainely expreſſed in the Scriptures, I haue heere in order ſet downe the ſumme &amp; ſubſtance of Chriſtian Religion, in certaine Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The order of it is this: The true knowledge of God and of Ieſus Chriſt, which is life eternall (that is the way and meanes to eternall life) is to be found in the Scriptures. Therfore firſt we begin with the Scriptures: then wee come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and of his workes, as of his eternall decree of Predeſtination, Creation, and Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, concerning Angels and men: in which, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence is to be conſidered, the fall of Angels and man, and the miſery that followed therof, namely, ſinne and death. Secondly, followeth Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant with man, namely, the couenant of works, and the couenant of grace. Concerning the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of workes, there is ſhewed the impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of keeping it, and to what end it ſerues. In the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:2418:45"/>couenant of grace is noted; Firſt, the foundation of it, which is Chriſt the Mediator. Secondly, the meanes of applying Chriſt vnto vs. In Chriſt wee are to conſider his perſon, and office. His office is threefold. The application of the couenant of grace, where is ſhewed the vnion &amp; communion which the elect haue with Chriſt. The meanes of the reuealing and applying of the couenant of grace, are eyther inward, as the Spirit of Chriſt, and faith; or outward, namely, the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, The ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of reuealing it, is our calling vnto Chriſt. The perſons to whom it is reuealed, namely, to the Church. As the benefit we receiue from the propheticall office of Chriſt, is the reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the couenant of grace, whereby we are made wiſe to ſaluation: ſo the benefit we receiue from the Prieſtly office of Chriſt is our inſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before God. The benefit we receiue from the kingly office of Chriſt is our glorification, which is partly in this preſent life, but fully and perfectly in the life to come. Our glorification in this life, conſiſteth in this, that in our condition we are made bleſſed, and made holy in our nature, which is Sanctification. The rule of Sanctification is the Word of God, euen the Law and the Goſpell. The effect of Sanctification, is Repentance. The notes of Repentance, are ſpecially two: A hatred of all ſinnes, and the practice of good workes. Among good workes, almes and prayer are ſpecially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to vs. The ſpeciall helps to prayer, and to the performing of other good workes, are vowes and faſting. Then laſtly is to be conſidered, Gods
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2418:46"/>dealing with man after this life, by bringing all men to Iudgement, which is eyther particular, or generall. And to the end that you may (in reading theſe Texts of Scripture) perceiue, how one thing depends vpon an other, I haue ſet downe (ouer the Texts of Scripture) the things whereof the places following doe ſpeake. If therefore you will accordingly be diligent inreading the Texts of Scripture, I doubt not but (by Gods grace aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting you) you ſhall in a ſhort time much benefit your ſelues thereby, and ſhall be able (when need requires) to proue any ground of Religion by ſome Text of Scripture. And ſo I commit you to the mercifull protection of Almighty God, beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching him to endue you with all ſauing grace, and to preſent you faultleſs before the preſence of his glory, with exceeding ioy, through Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>Amen.</hi>

They haue deuiſed many other new Articles of faith beſides, and contrary to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Apoſtles Créed: which they hold ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to be beléeued of all that will bée ſaued: As namely, indulgences and a treaſury of ſaints
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:2418:56"/>merits, the reall preſence, the Popes ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, Purgatorie, and ſuch like. In the Councell of Trent, the curſe <hi>Anathema</hi> is pronounced vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all ſuch as denie theſe or any of them. Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> firſt Vol. page <hi>621.</hi> The Créed tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth what euerie one in particular is to knowe and beleeue: and a true faith cannot ſtand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out certain knowledge. The Papiſts maintaine an implicite, or an ignorant faith; namely, that it is enough to beleeue as the Church beleeueth: though they know not what the Church is, nor what the Church beleeueth. And they commend this faith by the example of an old deuout father, a Colliar, who being tempted of the Diuell, and aſked how he beléeued; anſwered, That he belée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as the Church beléeued: being aſked againe how the Church beléeued, he anſwered, As I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue: whereupon, the Diuell (as they ſay) was faine to depart.</p>

                     <hi>It ſhould ſeeme it was but a ſimple diuell: for if he had bin wiſe, he would haue asked him this queſtion; What if the Church beleeue that thou art a foole; what would the Colliar think you haue anſwered then?</hi>

                  <p>I thinke hee would haue ſayd nothing: for if he ſhould haue ſaid, I beléeue ſo too, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell might then haue begged him for a foole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déede. And yet ſuch fooles are the ſimple &amp; igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:2418:57"/>Papiſts, which content themſelues with this kind of faith: for thus one may reaſon with them; You are to beléeue as the Church beléeueth: but the Church beléeues that you are fooles: therefore you are to beléeue ſo to. This their implicite faith euery one of himſelf may haue. The diuels in ſome ſence may be ſaid to haue a better faith then this: for they know what is contained in the Scriptures, and beléeue it to be true, <hi>Mat. 4.6. Iam. 2.19.</hi> This fond &amp; ridiculous kinde of faith, is a notable meanes to muzzle people in blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ſuperſtition and perpetuall ignorance. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine faith is a certaine and true perſwaſion of the heart, whereby wée are perſwaded, and in ſome meaſure aſſured of the forgiuenes of our ſinnes, and eternall ſaluation. The Papiſts ſay, It is preſumption to be aſſured of ſaluation, and will haue men to doubt thereof: the which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the nature of true faith. They call the certaintie of remiſſion of ſinnes, a faithles per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion: and the faith of diuels, not of Apoſtles. <hi>Concil. Trid. Seſſ. 6 cap. 9.12, 13. Rhemiſts Annot. 1.

                  <p>Concerning his perſon, although in words they confeſſe him to be God and man, yet indéed they deny it: for they aſcribe to him a body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible and infinite: they teach that hee is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally preſent in infinite places at once, which is proper onely to God, and contrary to the nature of a true body. And ſo in effect they do euen deny his Man-hood. The Sonne of God is called Ieſus, becauſe he is a Sauiour, yea the onely and perfect Sauiour which ſaueth vs from our ſinnes: that is, hath deliuered vs not onely from the blame, or guiltines, but fully alſo from the puniſhment due to our ſinnes, <hi>Mat. 1.21.

                  <p>Account you this blaſphemy? what ſay you then to that which <hi>Carolus Scribanius,</hi> a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit hath written of her?

Thirdly, that the beſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound for a ſick ſoule, is to mix together her milk, and Chriſts bloud. Fourthly, that the ſinnes and ſpirituall diſeaſes of the ſoule, are cured aſwel by her milk as by his bloud. Fiftly, that her milk and the merit and vertue of it, is more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and excellent then Chriſts bloud.

As they place S. <hi>Francis,</hi> and the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> in Chriſts roome, ſo doe they the Pope alſo: aſcribing that to him, which is proper vnto Ieſus Chriſt, and may
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:2418:60"/>not (without blaſphemie) be aſcribed to any creature. They ſay that the Pope is the Sunne: the Church the Moone. The Pope is the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom: the Church the Bride. The Pope is the head: the Church the body.

From whence we may thus reaſon, Without ſhedding of bloud is no remiſſion: but in the Maſſe is no ſhedding of bloud: therefore no remiſſion. And therefore it is no ſacrifice for ſinne.</p>

                  <p>The Fathers indéede make mention of vnbloody Sacrifices: but they hereby vnderſtand not outward and bodily Sacrifices for ſinne, but the Spirituall Sacrifices of Chriſtians; and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:2418:62"/>they ſo call them, in comparing them with the bloudy ſacrifices of the Law, and with Chriſts bloudy Sacrifice.</p>

                  <p>Their doctrine is, that it is a ſacrifice propitiatory: that is, auaileable to obtaine (<hi>ex opere operato,</hi> by the very worke wrought) remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and pardon of all their ſinnes: yea, that it is auaileable to obtain all other benefits; as peace, health, and ſuch like, <hi>Concil. Trid. Seſſ. 22. Can. 3. Bellarm. lib. 1. de Miſſ. cap. 25. lib. 2. cap. 9.</hi> But let it be (as you ſay) that they account it but an applicatory ſacrifice, yet this maketh nothing for them. The Sacrifices of the Law did ſerue to apply the vertue of Chriſts Croſſe: and yet the Apoſtle excludeth them by this reaſon; that where there is remiſſion of ſins, there is no more Sacrifice, <hi>Heb. 10.18.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Apoſtles reaſon be good, it concludeth alſo againſt their Sacrifice applicatory. Again, the Apoſtle teacheth, that therefore the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the Lawe are aboliſhed by the death of Chriſt; becauſe they were but ſhadowes of good
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:2418:62"/>things to come, and could not make the offerers perfect, &amp;c. <hi>Heb. 10.1, 2, 3.</hi> And therefore, this kind of applying Sacrifice (which they faine themſelues) hath ceaſed. Wée néede not now a Sacrifice for the application of Chriſts death: for Chriſt to that end hath appointed the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word, and hath inſtituted Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereby his death, with all the benefits thereof, are moſt fruitfully applied vnto vs, <hi>Gal. 3.1. 1. Cor. 11.26.</hi> Againe, this their apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſacrifice, is againſt the nature of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which God giues Chriſt vnto vs: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in a Sacrifice God receiues from man, and man giues ſomething to God.</p>

                  <p>It is true that they called it ſo: not that Chriſt is therein offered a Sacrifice to God, but in other reſpects. Firſt, becauſe that therein there was an offering and giuing of alms, bread, wine, &amp;c. which are a Spirituall Sacrifice. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they called the Sacrament, a Sacrifice, not properly, but figuratiuely: becauſe there was therein a repreſentation of that Sacrifice which was offered vpon the Croſſe, and becauſe it is a commemoration of Chriſts body, which he
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:2418:63"/>offered for vs, and of his bloud which he ſhed for vs. Thirdly, It is called a ſacrifice, becauſe it is an application of the Sacrifice offred vpon the Croſſe, vnto our ſelues. Fourthly, It is ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, becauſe of the ſacrifice of prayers and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuings: and becauſe in the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per wee offered our ſelues vnto God to bee conſecrated vnto him, and ſerue him in body and ſoule.</p>

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:2418:63"/>the offerings for the dead, which was but a thankſgiuing for them, vntill more then two hundred yéeres after CHRIST.

                  <p>Chriſts Prieſt-hood conſiſteth of two parts, Satisfaction, and Interceſſion.

                  <p>This is but an idle diſtinction: for Chriſt onely is the Mediatour aſwell of the one as the other. For in a true and ſufficient Mediatour, ther muſt be theſe properties: firſt of all, the word of God muſt reueale and propound him vnto the Church. Secondly, he muſt be perfectly iuſt, and ſuch a one as in whom was no ſinne euer found. Thirdly, he muſt be a Propitiatour, that is, bring ſome thing to God, that may appeaſe and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his wrath and iuſtice for our ſinnes.

                  <p>The Popiſts teach, that Chriſt hath ſatisfied for ſinnes going before Baptiſme: but concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſinnes following Baptiſme, the fault is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the paſſion of Chriſt, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (which of infinite is made finite) is to bee ſatisfied for, by men themſelues eyther heere or in Purgatorie: that is, men themſelues muſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the iuſtice of God, for the temporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their offences, eyther on earth or in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie.</p>
                  <p>There is (ſay they) a certaine infernall place in the earth, called Purgatorie, in the which as
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:2418:66"/>in a priſon-houſe, the ſoules which were not fully purged in this life, are there clenſed and purged by fire, before they can be receiued into heauen. <hi>Bellar. de Purgat. lib. 1. cap. 1. and cap. 3. lib. 2. cap. 6.

                  <p>Yes: The ſirth Article ſaith, that Chriſt aſcended into heauen, &amp;c. and the Scriptures ſay, that the heauens muſt containe him, &amp;c. <hi>Acts. 1.11.3.21.</hi> They teach contrary héereunto, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that Chriſt is corporally preſent in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and that in many places at once: The
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:2418:67"/>which is contrary to the nature of a true body, and contrary to the nature of the Sacrament, which is a remembrance of Chriſt. <hi>Vigilius</hi> againſt <hi>Eutyches. lib. 4.</hi> ſaith thus: When it (that is, the fleſh of Chriſt) was on earth, it was not in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: and becauſe it is now in heauen, it is not on earth. This is the Catholike faith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. It is an Article of faith to beléeue the Catholike Church: and faith is the euidence of things not ſéene, <hi>Heb. 11 1.</hi> Therfore the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church is alwaies vnto the world inuiſible, and not to be eſpied but by the eyes of faith: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe things ſeene are not beléeued. The Papiſts teach, that the Catholike Church is, and hath but alwaies viſible, <hi>Rhem. on Mat. 5. Sect. 3.</hi> The Church is ſaid to be Catholike, that is, vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, becauſe it is not tyed to any one ſpeciall place, but is ſpred abroad ouer the face of the earth. They tie it to Rome alone, which can be but a particular Church, and not vniuerſall. In the Church there is a Communion of Saints: and theſe are they that are ſanctified by the blond and Spirit of Chriſt, hauing the perfect holines of Chriſt put vpon them, by imputation of faith, and the quality of imperfect holines powred into their heart by the Spirit of ſanctification. And ſuch are the faithfull heere on earth. <hi>1. Cor. 1.2. Pſal. 16.2.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:2418:68"/>
                  <p>The Papiſts acknowledge none to be Saints, but ſuch as are in heauen. They teach that the Pope can canonize Saints: whereas to make one a Saint, is onely the work of God, <hi>1. Cor. 11.</hi> The Pope hath canonized many that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déede were neuer true Saints of God, but wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, and rank Traitors to their Princes, as <hi>Becket,</hi> with many others.</p>
                  <p>This canonizing of Saints, was neuer heard of with the Fathers, vntill the yéere <hi>880.</hi> and then <hi>Adrian</hi> took vp this authority. And <hi>Alexâder</hi> the Third, after him, confirmed it in his decrées.</p>
                  <p>In the Créed we profeſſe, to beléeue the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes of ſinnes: that is, I beléeue that God, for Chriſts ſake doth fréely forgiue the ſinnes of his elect, and my ſinnes alſo. And héerein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth our iuſtification, namely, in the frée for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes of our ſinnes, and the imputation of Chriſts righte ouſneſſe to vs. The Papiſts teach many things contrary to this Article. Firſt, that men are to make ſatisfaction for their ſinnes. Now: ſatisfaction for ſinnes, and forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ſinnes, are contraries. If wee ſatisfie in our owne perſon, we are not iuſtified fréely: if we be iuſtified fréely (as moſt certainly we are, <hi>Rom 3.23.</hi>) then we make no ſatisfaction at all. If a man can ſatisfie and pay a debt, then he néedes no forgiuenes: but if the debt be forgiuen
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:2418:68"/>him, then it is plaine, that there is no ſatisfaction made. The ſatisfaction for our ſinnes, was made by Chriſt, and not by vs.</p>

                  <p>The ſatisfaction which they maintained, was an eccleſiaſticall and publike mulct, or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty impoſed vpon notorious offenders, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to teſtifie their repentance, and to ſatisfie the Church whom they had offended, <hi>Perkins. 1.

                  </p>
                  <p>The efficient cauſe of our iuſtification, is God alone. It is God only that forgiueth our ſins. <hi>Eſa 43.25. Mar. 2.7. Ro. 8.33.</hi> They teach that the Pope can forgiue ſins, and we know that he giues pardons, not only for the time paſt, but alſo for the time to come: yea they teach that prieſts haue full right to remit ſins, &amp; they alleadge theſe places to prooue it: <hi>Mat. 16.19. Ioh. 20.23.</hi> Now we are to note this, that as none can forgiue a debt, but the party to whom y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> debt is due: ſo none can forgiue ſins, but God only, againſt whom the ſin is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, <hi>Pſ. 51.4.</hi> The power of binding and looſing committed to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles &amp; Miniſters of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Word, is, by declaring the wil and pleaſure of God out of his Word, both to pronounce forgiuenes of ſins to al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are truly penitent: and the retaining of them to the impenitent. The Pope and his Clergie are
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:2418:69"/>neuer able to proue themſelues to bee ſhe true Miniſters of Chriſt: and therefore they cannot ſo much as challenge this latter authoritie and power to themſelues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> much leſſe ſhe former, which is proper to God only. The motiue or impulſiue cauſe, which moued God to iuſtifie vs, was not any thing in vs, but only the grace of God, that is, the free good wil &amp; pleaſure of God, <hi>Ro. 3.24. Eph. 2 8. Tit. 3.5, 7.</hi> They teach, that we are not iuſtified by grace only, but by works alſo, that is, by the merit of our workes. And to this end they haue (of late yéeres) deuiſed a firſt and ſecand iuſtification. The firſt is, when a ſinner (of an euill man) is made a good man: and this (they ſay) commeth only of Gods mercie by the merit of Chriſt. The ſecond is, when one (of a good of iuſt man) is made better and more iuſt, and this procéedeth from workes.</p>
                  <p>But wee are to know, that there are not two kinos of iuſtification, a firſt and ſecond; but one and the ſame iuſtification, conſidered in different reſpects. In reſpect of Gods actuall acceptation of a maus perſon, iuſtification is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute: but in reſpect of the actuall application, and manifeſtation of Gods acceptation vnto a mans conſcience, iuſtification is by parts and degrées. (M. <hi>Scudder</hi> on the Lords Prayer, page <hi>303.</hi> to <hi>309.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:2418:69"/>
                  <p>And further we are to note, that the Papiſts ſecond iuſtification, is no other then ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is an effect and fruit of iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the which is imperfect, and not able to iuſtifie vs before God. Themateriall cauſe of our iuſtification, is the actiue and paſſiue righteouſneſſe and obedience of Ieſus Chriſt, his inherent holines, his fulfilling of the Law, his death, ſacrifice and full ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>The formal cauſe, or the forme of iuſtification, is the righteouſnes of Chriſt, imputed of God vnto vs, <hi>Rom. 5.19. Rom. 4.5, 6, 7, 8. 1. Cor. 1.30. 2. Cor. 5.19, 21. Phil. 3.9.</hi> The Papiſts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide this doctrine, that Men are iuſtified by the imputation of the righteouſnes of Chriſt: which righteouſnes is not in vs, but in Chriſt. The <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> call it a new no-iuſtice, a phantaſticall apprehenſion of that which is not, <hi>Rhem. on Ro. 3. Sect. 7.</hi> They hold them accurſed that ſo affirm and teach: And they teach, that the onely formall cauſe of our iuſtification, is the iuſtice of God, whereby we are not reputed and accounted iuſt, but are made iuſt indéede: and this iuſtice is that which euery man hath within himſelfe, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in him, <hi>Concil. Trid. Seſſ. 6. can. 10.11. Rhem. on Phil. chap. 3. Sect. 3.</hi> The inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall cauſe of iuſtification on our part, is a true and liuely faith, whereby wee receiue
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:2418:70"/>and apply vnto our ſelues the merrie of God, Chriſt Ieſus and all his benefits, reſting vpon him alone for our ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>They teach, that faith doth not iuſtifie, as an inſtrument in apprehending the righteouſnes of Chriſt, but as a proper and true cauſe, it actually iuſtifieth by the dignity, worthines and meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous work thereof, <hi>Bellarm. lib. 1. de iuſtificat. cap. 17.</hi> They teach alſo, that faith is not the only cauſe of our iuſtification, but that there are other alſo, as hope, charity, almes-déedes and other vertues: yea they ſay, that workes are more prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall then faith, in the matter of iuſtification: and pronounce him accurſed that ſhall ſay, a man is iuſtified onely by faith, <hi>Rhem. on Rom. 8. Sect. 6. and on Iames 2. Sect. 7. Bellarm. lib. 1. de iuſtificat. cap. 13. Concil. Trid. Seſſ. 6. can. 9.</hi> Theſe and other ſuch like things they teach, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the doctrine of iuſtification, which is a maine ground of Religion. And if there were no more points of difference betweene vs; theſe were ſufficient to kéepe vs from vniting of our religions: for héereby the Church of Rome doth raze the very foundation.</p>

By which it appeareth, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of our ſelues, we are iuſtified fréely of Gods méere mercie and grace, without any reſpect of our owne righteouſnes or worthines, but yet through Chriſt, and for his righteouſnes and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience imputed to vs: both which are ſignified by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 3.23, 24.</hi>

                     <hi>Shew mee (I pray you) what is meant by (Merit) what the doctrine of the Papiſts is concerning merit, and whether that our works be meritorious or no.</hi>

                  <p>By (Merit) we vnderſtand any thing, or any worke, whereby Gods fauour and life euerlaſting is procured; and that for the dignitie and excellencie of the work or thing done. Now the true merit whereby we looke to attaine the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of God and life euerlaſting, is to be found in the perſon of Chriſt alone, in whom God is well pleaſed. The Papiſts make two kindes of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: the merit of the perſon, and the merit of the worke. The merit of the perſon is (as they ſay) a dignitie in the perſon, whereby it is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of life euerlaſting. The merit of the worke, is a dignity or excellencie in the work, whereby it is made fit, &amp; inabled to deſerue life euerlaſting
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:2418:71"/>for the doer of the worke: <hi>See Rhem. on. Rom. 8. Sect. 5.</hi> We now do renounce our owne perſonall merits, and all merit of our owne workes, and rely onely vpon the merits of Chriſt, and wee hold that no workes of ours can merit. That no man by any workes of his can merit, may bee proued by the properties and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions that muſt be in a worke meritorious, and they are fiue.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the worke muſt be abſolutely perfect: but all our workes are vnperfect, aſwell in parts, as in degrées of accompliſhment. In parts, becauſe we omit many things which the Law preſcribeth, and doe many euill things which the Law prohibiteth. In degrees, becauſe the workes of the Saints are vncleane, <hi>Eſay. 64.6. Phil. 3.8.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, a man muſt doe the worke of himſelfe, and by himſelfe: for if it bee done by the hélpe of another, the merit doth not properly belong to the dooer. But the good workes which we doe, are not ours, but are wrought by God in vs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a man muſt doe the worke, of his owne free will and pleaſure, not of due debt: for when we doe that which we are bound to doe, we doe no more but our duty. But whatſoeuer we doe, we doe it as poore debters, nay, we are
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:2418:71"/>worſe then poore debters; wee are miſerable bankrupts, wee haue nothing, wee haue leſſe then nothing to pay, <hi>Luke 17.10.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the worke muſt bée done to the benefit and profit of him from whom we looke to be repayed. But no man by any worke of his can bring any profit vnto God, <hi>Iob 22.2.35.7. Pſal. 16.2.50.12.</hi> Wée may benefit men but wée cannot benefit our Maker, from whome wee haue receiued life and limbe, ſoule and body, and all that we haue: wee can giue him nothing, and therefore can deſerue nothing from him, <hi>Ro. 11.35, 36.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the worke and the reward muſt be in proportion equall: for if the reward be more then the worke, it is not then a reward of deſert, but a gift of good will. But there is no proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene our workes, which are altogether vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and the excellencie of thoſe great bleſſings, and benefits which the Father giueth vs freely in his Sonne, <hi>Rom. 8.18.</hi> And therefore in this and the former reſpects, there can bee no merit in any meere man: wherefore it is no leſſe abſurd to ſay, that wee merit ſaluation at Gods hands by good workes, then if one ſhould ſay, Thou haſt giuen mee an hundred pounds, therefore thou oughteſt to giue mee a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</p>

                  <p>It ſerues greatly to maintaine and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Popes kingdome: for they teach, that the ouer-plus of Chriſts merits, and of the merits of Saints and Martyrs, is the treaſure of the Church, which being gathered together, and put into a ſtore-cheſt, is in the Popes cuſtodie, and he alone hath the plenary opening and ſhutting of this Cheſt, and the ordering and diſpoſing of theſe merits: by vertue whereof, he giues out Indulgences and Pardons when and to whom he will: So that ſuch as haue not merits enow of their owne, may haue them from thence.

                  <p>No ſurely: for there are foure things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily required to make a Sacrament. Firſt, the authority of Chriſt commanding it. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the element or outward ſigne, as the matter of it. Thirdly, the word of inſtitution, as the forme. Fourthly, the end and vſe, to bee a ſcale of our faith, for remiſſion of ſinnes. Theſe foure things are not to be found, in their fiue latter Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and therefore they are no Sacraments indéede. <hi>Maſter Atterſoll</hi> on the Sacraments, <hi>page. 119. to 150.

                  <p>None may ordain a Sacrament, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Lord. As none may put a ſigne and ſeale to a mans laſt will and Teſtament, but onely the maker of the Teſtament: ſo none may ordaine
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:2418:73"/>Sacraments (which are ſignes and ſeales of the new Teſtament and couenant of grace) but onely the Lord which made the couenant. And therefore the Church of Rome, in doing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, proues her ſelfe not to be the true Church of Chriſt, but rather the Church of Antichriſt. They doe alſo in many other things teach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the doctrine of the Sacraments. As,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that the Sacraments doe giue grace, and namely, remiſſion of ſinnes, <hi>ex opere operato;</hi> by the worke wrought, <hi>Rhem. Acts. 22. Sect. 1.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, that not onely faith doth iuſtifie, but the Sacraments alſo, <hi>Rhem. Rom. 6. Sect. 5.</hi> Whereas Sacraments me ſignes and ſeales of iuſtification. <hi>Rom. 4.11.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that Infants dying without Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, cannot bee ſaued, <hi>Rhem. Iohn 3. Sect. 2.</hi> They haue alſo added many idle ceremonies to Baptiſme, as Creame, Tapers, Salt, &amp;c. with an opinion of ſaluation and worſhip annexed vnto them: yea in times paſt they baptized bells, but now they beginne to bee aſhamed of it, and ſay that they were but onely hallowed, and conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to holy vſes, <hi>Bellarm. lib. 4. de. Pont. Rom. cap. 12. Synopſis Papiſmi, Controuerſie 12. Queſtion 5.</hi> Concerning the Lords Supper, they haue likewiſe moſt groſty abuſed it in many things.</p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:2418:74"/>
                  <p>Firſt, they take away the Cup from the Laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: whereas the Church of Rome for aboue a thouſand yéeres after Chriſt, vſed both ſignes in the Communion. The Communion vnder one kinde, was decréed, defined, and determined as a publike Law in the Councell of Conſtance, about the yéere <hi>1114. Perk. 2. vol. 554 2. b.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, they reſerue the bread in boxes, pixes and other veſſels of the Church, for daies, wéekes, and moneths. They ſhew it to the people, the Prieſt lifting it ouer his head, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it in proceſſion. All this is contrary to the Sacrament: for it is no Sacrament, vnleſſe there bee a giuing, receiuing, eating, and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, <hi>Maſter Atterſoll</hi> on the Sacraments, <hi>386.387.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reſeruation of the Sacrament was not allowed of, but rather found fault withall by the Fathers, <hi>Perk. 2. vol. 557.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they adore, fall downe and honour the Sacrament with diuine worſhip, calling it their Lord and God. A thing neuer heard of among the heathen Idolaters, namely, to worſhip a piece of bread, or rather, a thinne wafer.</p>
                  <p>The adoration in the Sacrament belongeth vnto Chriſt ſitting in heauen: and is an inward worſhip of the heart, or lifting vp of the minde, being ſtirred vp with the outward ſignes. Pope
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:2418:74"/>
                     <hi>Honorius</hi> the Third (in the yéere <hi>1220</hi>) was the firſt that euer inſtituted the adoration of the Sacrament. And after him <hi>Vrban</hi> the fourth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained a feaſt in honour of the body of Chriſt. <hi>Perk. 2 Vol. 564. Atterſoll</hi> on the Sacraments. <hi>388.389.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, they turne the Sacrament into a ſacrifice for the quick and the dead, aboliſhing the fruit and remembrance of the death of Chriſt, diſannulling his Prieſt-hood, giuing him to his Father, wheras the Father hath giuen him to vs, &amp;c. <hi>ibid. page 390.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fiftly, they maintaine Tranſubſtantiation. Theſe are their very words: If any man ſhall ſay, that there remaineth the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine in the Sacrament, after the words of conſecration, or ſhall denie that the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Bread &amp; Wine is changed &amp; conuerted into the body and bloud of Chriſt (the formes &amp; ſhews only of Bread &amp; Wine remaining: which ſingular and miraculous conuerſion the Church calleth, Tranſubſtantiation): let him be accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. <hi>Con. Trid. Seſſ. 13. can. 2.</hi> This their doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, is a very fable to mock fooles withall, and it ouerturneth both the nature and vſe of the Sacrament, <hi>Atterſoll</hi> on the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, <hi>page 45. 46. and page 365. to 369.</hi> If there were a miraculous conuerſion (as they
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:2418:75"/>ſay there is) of the Bread and Wine, it would appeare to the outward ſenſes. For all true mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles are wrought openly, clearely, and euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to mens ſenſes, <hi>Iohn 6.26.</hi> But the Bread and Wine, by the iudgement of all the ſenſes, remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and appeareth to bée the ſame in ſubſtance which it was before, of the ſame quality quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, colour, taſte, handling, ſmelling, vertue and nouriſhment: there is not any one ſenſe, or all the ſenſes together, that can iudge otherwiſe of it, then it did before. If a man ſhould bee called in, when the Bread and Wine is ſet on the Table, and bidden to conſider well what hee there ſéeth, ſmelleth and taſteth, and then is willed to goe forth, and to come in againe, after the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ended by the Prieſt, and to doe the like: and then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is asked what he thinketh of it: he, no doubt, will anſwere (vnleſſe feare of perſecution make him to conceale the truth) I ſee, feele, ſmell, and taſte the ſame water-cake, and wine that I did before. I can perceiue no naturall and ſubſtantiall change therein. And therefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that there is no miracle wrought, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently; no Tranſubſtantiation at all. The difference that is, is in the end and vſe onely. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſecration, it was common bread &amp; wine, ordained for the nouriſhing of our bodies. After conſecration, it becommeth holy Bread &amp; Wine,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:2418:75"/>ſanctified by the Lord, not ſo much to féede the body, as the ſoule.</p>

                     <hi>I am ſatisfied touching the firſt poynt, namely, that the Papiſts are not of ſound faith: but how doe you proue that they are not of good life, ſeeing they doe ſo many good workes?</hi>

                  <p>I proue it thus: Where the doctrine is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, the life cannot be good: but their doctrine (as you haue heard) is moſt corrupt, therefore their life cannot bee good. A true faith is the ground of a good life, and without which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to pleaſe God, <hi>Heb. 11.6.</hi> Yea, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is not of faith, is ſinne, <hi>Rom. 14.23.</hi> A true faith they haue not, and therefore their workes cannot bee good, and ſuch as may pleaſe God. That they haue not a true and ſound faith, hath bin ſhewed in many particulars, and it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appeareth alſo in this, that they doe euen wilfully reied ſhe meanes wherby it is wrought, namely, the preaching, hearing and reading the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2418:76"/>Word of God. They haue not, neither will they haue the Scriptures to be ſoundly preached, read, and heard in their owne tongue. That they cannot abide to haue them in their owne language, appeareth by this one example: One Pauier a Towne-clarke of London, (in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eightth) hearing that the Scriptures ſhould bee put into Engliſh, hee ſpake to this effect, and confirmed it with an oath: <hi>viz.</hi> that if hee knew that the Scriptures ſhould bee put into Engliſh, and that the King would haue them to bee read in the Church, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then hee would liue ſo long to ſee it, he would cut his owne throat: But (as <hi>Hall</hi> ſaith, who heard him ſpeake it) hee was not ſo good as his word: for, in ſtead of cutting his throat, he han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelfe.</p>

                  <p>S. <hi>Iohn</hi> giues the reaſon.

                  <p>Yes, they do both teach &amp; practiſe many things directly contrary to Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. They teach for good workes, ſuch things as are not commanded, but rather forbidden in the Law of God, as namely, to goe on Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, to vow ſingle life, to faſt forty dayes and forty nights, &amp;c.</p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:2418:77"/>
                  <p>Firſt, concerning ſet Pilgrimages vnto cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Images: there was none of the Fathers that did ſo much as dreame of them for <hi>600.</hi> yéers after Chriſt at the leaſt, <hi>Perkins 2.</hi> Vol. page <hi>541, 542.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the neceſſitie of the vowe of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency was eſtabliſhed firſt, and annered vnto Orders, about <hi>380.</hi> yéeres after Chriſt, and that by Pope <hi>Siricius.</hi> But it had no vniuerſall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, vntill the time of Pope <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> in the yéere <hi>1070.

                  <p>Thirdly, their doctrine of ſingle life was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner commanded of God, nor knowne in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, but hath ſprung vp ſince, and is indeed the very doctrine of diuels, <hi>1.

                  <p>I could plainly proue vnto you, that they doe both teach and practiſe many things contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to euery one of the Commandements: but I wil onely ſet downe the chiefeſt, and ſuch as moſt men know to be true.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, Commandement concernes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worſhip of God: the ground of which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is the true knowledge of God; and without which none can truly worſhip and ſerue him: for ſuch as our knowledge is, ſuch is our worſhip. <hi>1. Chron. 28.9. Pſal. 9.10. Ier. 9.24.</hi> The Papiſts teach, that ignorance is the mother of deuotion: but the truth is, it is the mother of ſuperſtition and idolatry, <hi>Gal. 4.8.</hi> The Papiſts therefore being ignorant and without the true knowledge of God, cannot truely worſhip him, but muſt néeds bee Idolaters, worſhipping they know
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2418:78"/>not what. The firſt Commandement requireth, that we haue the true <hi>Iehoua</hi> for our onely God. They make Chriſts body to bee God, becauſe they hold that it may be in many places at once, which thing is proper onely to God. They make the Pope to bee God, and that in plaine words. <hi>Chriſtopher Marcellus</hi> ſaid to the Pope, Thou art another God vpon earth, and the Pope tooke it to himſelfe, <hi>Concil Later. Seſſ. 4.</hi>
                  </p>

As that hee can make holy, that which is vnholy, pardon ſinnes, &amp;c. <hi>Perk. 1. vol. 400.1.</hi> and they giue diuine worſhip to creatures, and ſo make them their Gods. The ſecond Commandement concerneth the outward worſhip of God, or the forme and manner of his worſhip. This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement they haue cleane put out of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue, and to fill vp the number, they diuide the laſt into two. The ſcope of this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is, that no image is to be made of God, nor any worſhip performed to him in an image, <hi>Deut. 4.15, 16.</hi> But they teach it lawfull to make images of the true God, and to worſhip him in them, and that there is a religious worſhip due to them, <hi>Bellar. de imag. ſanct. lib. 2. cap. 21.</hi> And in the ſecond <hi>Nicen</hi> Councell it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that the Image of God ſhould be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:2418:79"/>with the ſame worſhip that is due vnto God. Their practice is anſwerable to their doctrine: for they worſhip the Images of God, of Chriſt, the Saints, the woodden Croſſe, yea a piece of bread.</p>

                  <p>Suppoſe that this were true, yet in ſo doing, they commit groſſe idolatry, and the ſame that the people of Iſrael did, for which God pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued them greatly, <hi>Exod. 32.5, 28.</hi> I think there is none ſo very a Calfe, as to thinke that they did worſhip the Calfe it ſelfe. The Calfe was but a repreſentation of God; and yet they ſinned greatly in making it, and worſhipping God in it. The Heathen in times paſt could ſay as much for themſelues, concerning their worſhipping of Images, as the Papiſts now do: and yet as they were Idolaters, ſo are the Papiſts: for as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their ſuperſtition and idolatry, bloud can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be more like to bloud, or an egge to an egge, then one of them is to another. The Heathen had for euery nation and prouince, ſome peculiar god. Among them, the Elements had their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall gods to rule ouer them. The Heathen had a certaine god aſſigned to their cattell. The Heathen had peculiar gods for learning and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:2418:79"/>learned men, and for handi-crafts men. And all theſe haue the Papiſts likewiſe. The Heathen erected Altars, ordained Prieſts to offer ſacrifices, fell downe before their idols, &amp;c. So the Papiſts deck and adorne their images, go on Pilgrimage to them, fall downe vpon their knées before them, and make their prayers vnto them. And what is all this, but to worſhip the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry images themſelues, the which is moſt groſſe idolatry? <hi>Muſculus</hi> on <hi>Pſal. 16. v. 4. page. 139.140.

                  <p>Yes, To the right worſhipping of God, there is required a reuerend vſe of the meanes of Gods worſhip and ſeruice, the which are ſincere prayer, preaching, hearing of Gods Word, and the vſe of ſhe Sacraments. Concerning praier, if muſt be made wiſh vnderſtanding, <hi>1. Cor. 14. v. 15.</hi> Contrary heereunto is their praying in an vnknowne tongue. In the pureſt Churches for the ſpace of <hi>800</hi> yéers at the leaſt, diuine prayer was neuer performed in a tongue vnknowne to the people, <hi>Perk. 2. vol. 557.</hi> Concerning the Sacraments, they do not rightly adminiſter and receiue them, but haue added and taken from them at their pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>The helps and furtherances of Gods worſhip are ſpecially two; howes &amp; faſting. The Papiſts
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:2418:80"/>make theſe to bee parts of Gods worſhip: yea they make faſting to be a worke of ſatisfaction to Gods iuſtice, for the temporall puniſhment of ſinne, and a meritorious worke, <hi>Rhem. on 1.

                  <p>Yes, The third Commandement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the glorifying of GODs name in the whole courſe of our life. They teach men to giue the glory which is proper to God, to creatures, as to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the Pope, &amp;c. They teach it lawfull to ſweare by Saints, and not by God onely. They maintaine periurie, becauſe they teach with one conſent, that one beeing exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, may anſwer doubtfully againſt the direct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the Examiner, framing another mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:2418:81"/>to himſelfe in the doubtfulnes of his words. As for example, A man is asked whether he were not ſuch a day at the Maſſe, in ſuch a place? They affirme that he may ſay no, and ſweare vnto it (although he were at it) reſeruing this to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; not with purpoſe to reueale it to the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner: whereas (in the very Law of nature) hée that takes an oath, ſhould ſweare according to the intention of him that hath power to adminiſter an oath: and that in truth, iudgement and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, <hi>Ieremy 4.2.</hi> Thy are alſo egregious blaſphemers of Gods name. They haue vttered moſt horrible blaſphemies concerning the Scriptures. See Doctor <hi>Willets</hi> foure pillers of Papiſtry, <hi>page 49. to 61.</hi> The fift Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement requireth ſubiection and obedience to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, and namely, to Kings and Princes, who are ſupreme and next vnder Chriſt, <hi>Rom. 13.1, 2. 1. Pet. 2.13.</hi> They teach that the Pope is ſupreme head, ouer all perſons, &amp;c. that hee oweth no ſubiection to Kings and Princes, but hath power to make them, and to put them downe at his pleaſure. The Pope and his Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie will not be in ſubiection to them, but rather exerciſe Lord-ſhip ouer them. The Popes ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie was vnheard of and vnknowne, till the yeere of Chriſt <hi>600.</hi> It was firſt brochedby the murthering Emperour <hi>Phocas,</hi> at the ambitious
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:2418:81"/>deſire of the proud Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the Third, about the yeere <hi>607.</hi> And ſince that time, the Popes haue ſhewed their intolerable pride, in their behauiour towards Princes. The Pope in his writings calles himſelfe, <hi>Seruus ſernorum Dei,</hi> The ſeruant of Gods ſeruants: but in his actions he will be <hi>Dominus dominorum,</hi> the Lord of Lords: wherein he plainely ſheweth himſelfe to be that man of ſinne and Antichriſt, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth himſelfe aboue all that is called God, <hi>2.

                  <p>Yes, Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seuenth, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> hired one to kill the Emperour. A Monk poyſoned King <hi>Iohn.

                  <p>This doctrine was neuer maintained by any Heretikes (beſides the Papiſts) as our moſt Chriſtian and learned King hath ſhewed in a ſpeech of his, vttered in the Parliament houſe, in the yeere <hi>1605.</hi> by occaſion of the Gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Treaſon: And heerein you may ſee how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary they are both to the doctrine and practice of the Prophets, Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, who both taught and practiſed ſubiection, euen to wicked and idolatrous Princes, and did neuer ſo much as attempt to hurt them. As for example: <hi>Saul</hi> was a wicked King, for ſaken of God, and one that did moſt cruelly perſecute <hi>Dauid,</hi> who was anointed to be King after him. At two ſeuerall times the Lord deliuered <hi>Saul</hi> into his hands, ſo that hee might (without any reſiſtance) haue killed him: yea, <hi>Abiſhai</hi> deſired that hee might ſtrike him but once with his ſpeare.

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:2418:83"/>hand on the Lords anointed, &amp; be guiltles? Nay, his heart ſmote him for cutting off the skirt of <hi>Sauls</hi> Robe, <hi>1. Sam. 24.4, 5, 6. &amp;c. chap. 26.8.9, &amp;c.</hi> And afterwards, when one brought tidings to <hi>Dauid</hi> that hee had ſlaine <hi>Saul,</hi> what did <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid?</hi> Did hee commend him for it, as the Pope did the Fryer? No, he cauſed him to be ſlaine for his labour, <hi>2. Sam. 1.14, 15, 16.</hi> Now what think you of <hi>Dauid?</hi>

                  <p>The ninth Commandement condemns all lying, and diſſimulation, railing, mocking, &amp;c. They maintaine equiuocation, which (as the Secular Prieſts haue ſaid) <hi>(Quodlibet 2.

They are not orious lyers, &amp; ſlanderers, railers and workers, <hi>Willet on Iude page 195 and 205. 212.</hi> They haue falſified mens writings, putting in, and putting out what they, pleaſe, as is to bee ſéene in their <hi>Index expurgatorius. <hi>See Perk. 2. vol. page 489, &amp;c.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>There haue bin in times paſt games appointed for lying. If there were any ſuch now, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts would carry the whet ſtone from all the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes in Chriſtendome. The tenth Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement condemneth originall corruption, and the very euill thoughts and luſts of the heart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſent.</p>
                  <p>They teach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that concupiſcence in it ſelfe is not ſinne. Theſe are the very words of the Concell of Trent: This concupiſcence (which
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:2418:85"/>the Apoſtle ſometime calleth ſinne) the holy <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod</hi> declareth, that the Catholike Church did neuer vnderſtand to be called ſinne, becauſe it is truly and properly ſinne in the regenerate, but becauſe it commeth of ſinne, and inclineth vnto ſinne. If any man thinke the contrary, let him be accurſed, <hi>Seſſ 5. cap. 1. de pecc. orig.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they both decrée againſt the Apoſtle himſelfe, <hi>Rom. 7.23.</hi> and alſo they gain-ſay themſelues: for if this concupiſcence boyle out of originall ſin, as out of a fountaine, and that is damnable: it followeth, that conrupiſence or luſt is alſo ſinne before God, and doth deſerue condemnation. They ſay that in the regenerate it is veniall. But this is an vndoubted principle, that all ſinnes in themſelues and their owne nature are mortall. And concerning this veniall ſinne, it was not knowne among the Fathers for <hi>700</hi> yéeres after Chriſt. And thus you ſee, what groſſe things they both teach &amp; practiſe contrary to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God: whereby it plainely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that Popery cannot be of God: for thus I reaſon: Whatſoeuer religion doth teach things contrary to the Commandements of God, is not of God: but Poperie doth ſo, and therefore it is not of God: and ſo by good conſequence Papiſts cannot be good Catholikes.</p>

                  <p>They doe likewiſe teach and practiſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things contrary thereunto, I will but onely name ſome of them. The Lords prayer teacheth vs to call vpon God onely. They teach and practiſe prayer to Saints. In the firſt petition we pray for the hallowing of Gods name. They giue vnto Saints departed, that which is proper to God, and ſo diſhonour Gods name. In the ſecond poſition we pray for the erecting of Gods Kingdom of grace in our hearts, and alſo for the meanes thereof, namely, the preaching and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Gods Word They hinder the comming of Gods kingdom, in reiecting the Word of God, and in perſecuting ſuch as will preach heere and reade it. Contrary to the third petition is their doctrine of frée-will. Contrary to the fift petition, is their doctrine of ſatisfaction for ſin. In the ſixt petition, we pray for ſtrength to withſtand Satan and his temptations. They teach people to driue away the diuell with holy water, and ſuch like
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:2418:86"/>childiſh toyes. Theſe and other ſuch like things they teach &amp; practiſe contrary to the Lords prayer.</p>

Some think that our Religion, and the religion of the preſent Church of Rome, are all one for ſubſtance, and that they may be vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: but they are groſſly deceiued: for a vnion of theſe two religions can neuer bee made, more then the vnion of light and darknes, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Church of Rome (as hath at large bin ſhewed) hath ſtrooke at the very foundation.</p>

                  <speaker>M.</speaker>
                  <p>One ſpeciall cauſe of it is, that becauſe men will not receiue the loue of the truth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhould beléeue a lie, <hi>2. Theſ. 2.10, 11.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A ſecond cauſe is ignorance of the Scriptures, and of the grounds of Religion, for if men would well acquaint themſelues héerewith, they ſhould eaſily fee the groſſenes of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</p>
                  <p>A third cauſe is, that Popery is very agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and pleaſing to mans corrupt nature: As for example: to be iuſtified by our good workes: to haue Images to worſhip God in: to liue in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: to haue pardons for our ſinnes: to ſerue God in outward ceremonies, as in choice of meat, difference of daies, &amp;c. theſe are things very agreeable and pleaſing to our corrupt nature, and therefore one ſpeciall cauſe why ſo many embrace Popery.</p>
                  <p>A fourth cauſe is, the tyrannie. of the Church of Rome, whoſe chiefe meanes to vphold her religion, is fire and ſword: for were it not for this, many thouſands in a few yeeres would vtterly renounce Poperie.</p>
                  <p>A fift cauſe why ſo many (ſpecially of the Learned) doe embrace it is pomp and profit: that is, ambition and couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:2418:87"/>
                  <p>This was that which made the Scribes and Phariſes (euen againſt their owne knowledge) to withſtand Chriſt and his Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>And this makes many learned Papiſts to doe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like. They know (no doubt) that in ſome things they erre: as it doth appeare by the words of <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen Gardiner</hi> on his death bead.</p>
                  <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter</hi> ſéeing him to be in a deſperate caſe, comforteth him with the hope of remiſſion of ſinnes by the merits of Chriſt. <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner</hi> héereunto anſwereth thus: What, will you open that gape now? you may ſpeake it to mee, &amp; to ſuch as are in my caſe: but if you teach it to the people, then farewell all; meaning, our autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, pompe, and profit by abſolutions, Maſſes, &amp;c.

                     <hi>There is one thing more that I would gladly know concerning the Papiſts, and that is, whether a Papiſt may be ſaued, ſeeing that Poperie is ſo contrary to the grounds of Religion.</hi>

                  <speaker>M.</speaker>
                  <p>You are then to marke what a Papiſt is. A Papiſt (as the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> on <hi>Acts 11. Sect 4.</hi> doe deſcribe him) is one that clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to the Pope in Religion, and is obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to him in all things.</p>
                  <p>Euery one now that is vnder the iuriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:2418:88"/>of the Pope, is not to be counted a Papiſt: for their are ſome euen in <hi>Italy, Spaine, &amp;c.</hi> that hold the Grounds of Religion, doe ſigh and grone vnder the Romiſh yoke, and deſire to bee fréed from it, yea would reioice to ſee it.</p>
                  <p>Againe, there may be ſome, that (for want of knowledge, and the meanes thereof) are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with ſome points of Popery, but yet they hold the foundation, which is <hi>CHRIST IESVS,</hi> and looke to be ſaued by his merits, and not by their owne or any others. Such we account not Papiſts, our the true Church and children of God. But by Papiſts, we meane ſuch as cleaue faſt to the Pope in religion, are in all things obedient to him, will not be reclaimed from their errours, refuſe to heare the Word of God, to read the Scriptures, or any other good books. 'Of ſuch wée may boldly ſay, that if they thus continue to the end, they cannot bee ſaued.</p>

                  <p>In all ſubſtantiall points of Religion wée agree both amongſt our ſelues, and alſo with all other ſound Proteſtants in Chriſtendome. In other things there haue bin, are, and will bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities of opinions &amp; differences to the worlds end. They ſhould firſt pluck out the beame of their owne eyes: for we can truly charge them with greater differences: As namely, with that ſharpe and bloudy contention betweene the Franciſcans and Dominicans; and with the late bitter contention between the Ieſuites, &amp; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Prieſts: wherein the Prieſts did write as bitterly againſt the Ieſuites (and namely, againſt <hi>Parſons</hi>) as euer did any Proteſtant: nay there
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:2418:89"/>was neuer any Proteſtant Writer that did lay ſuch foule and odious crimes to their charge, as the Prieſts did. And heerein they verified the old prouerb, When théeues fall by the eares, true men come to haue their goods. For one diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is among vs, they haue (at leaſt) ten among themſelues. <hi>Doctor Willet</hi> (in his fourth Piller of Papiſtry) hath ſet downe at large,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the contradictions and diuerſe opinions of old Papiſts and new.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the contradictions of the Ieſuites among themſelues.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that their ſtouteſt Champion, <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> is at variance with himſelfe, ſhamefully forgetting himſelfe, ſaying and vnſaying: now of one opinion, by and by of another.

                  <p>In the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> the inceſtuous man was not puniſhed: fornication was lightly regarded, yea there were ſome that euen denied the Reſurrection, yet S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth account and call them the Church and Saints: hee doth not perſwade any to make a ſeparation, but doth plainely rebuke them, and ſheweth how they ſhould puniſh the euill doer.

For if euer they were truly begotten vnto Chriſt, and borne anew, it hath hin by our Church and our Miniſterie, by which likewiſe they haue bin trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vp, and brought to that knowledge which they haue.</p>

                  <p>Though they liue in the Church, yet they are not of the Church: they are but Hypocrites, and ſhall (if they repent not) haue the reward of Hypocrites: yea it ſhall be eaſier in the day of iudgement for many Papiſts, then for them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by their barren and fruitleſſe, yea wicked life, they haue cauſed the name of God, his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and the true profeſſours thereof, to bee euill ſpoken of. Let all therefore that will bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the true Church, and true Chriſtians, bee carefull to adorne the doctrine of God our Sauiour in all things, and that by a godly conuerſation, and by dooing of good workes.</p>
